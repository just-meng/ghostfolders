## Surgery
* Mouse was anaesthetized using Ketamine (125 mg/kg) / Xylazin (10 mg/kg) and placed into the stereotaxic apparatus on a heating pad. 80 ul of dexamethasone (4 mg/ml) was given intramuscularly. Ointment (Bepathen) was applied to the eyes of the mouse.
* Lidocaine (10 mg/ml) was injected below the skin covering the skull before removing the skin.
* A craniotomy of 3.5 mm diameter was performed over S1 using a biopsy punch (Stiefel, 3.5 mm).
* A dissecting knife (FST, #10055-12) is attached to the stereotaxic arm, and lowered 1.3 mm into the brain, and slowly advanced 1.5-1.7 mm in a lateral-medial fashion. The center of the incision was at 2.0-2.4 mm lateral and 1.15-1.58 posterior to Bregma.
* Once the bleeding subsided, a total of 200 nl of the genetically  encoded calcium indicator AAV2/1-Syn-GCaMP6s-WPRE (Penn Vector Core) was injected into somatosensory cortex (lateral, 1.4-2.4; posterior, 1.3-1.6 mm from Bregma) at 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.3 mm below the pial surface.
* A right-angled microprism (1mm x 1mm) attached to the bottom of a three-layered cranial window made of a 4, 3, and 3 mm diameter (from top to bottom) round coverglasses (#1 thickness) using Norland Optical Adhesive 71 was inserted into the previously made incision and secured to the skull using superglue followed by self-adhesive resin cement RelyX.
* A headpost is attached to the skull using self-adhesive resin cement (RelyX) and denture acrylic (Paladur).
* Buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) and carprofen (5 mg/kg) were administered and the mouse was allowed to recover.

## Drugs
All drugs were mixed with 0.9% saline to create a concentration that allows the injection of 0.005 ml of the mixture for 1 g mouse. The respective concentration is adapted for the following doses:
* Dimethyltryptamine: 1, 10, 25 mg/kg
* Ketamine: 10, 30, 100 mg/kg
* Salvinorin A: 1, 3, 10 mg/kg

## Two-photon calcium imaging
* resonant-scanning two-photon microscope (Thorlabs) equipped with GaAsP photomultiplier tubes 
* GCaMP6s was excited at 930 nm (typically 20–30 mW at the sample) with a Ti:Sapphire laser and imaged through a 16×, 0.8 NA water immersion objective (Nikon)
* Full-frame images (512 × 512 pixels) were acquired through the microprism at a distance of 50-150 μm from the prism face at 29.97 Hz using ScanImage 4.1 software
